# BanItem
A PocketMine plugin

My first attempt at plugin dev... a fork of LDX's BanItem plugin:
 
Logs information to Console for any players trying to use banned items, and where it happened.
Logs items banned/unbanned.

Commands (all default to OP):

/banitem add 57 - ban diamond block
/banitem unban 57 - unban diamond block
/banitem list - list all banned blocks
/banitem report - toggles in-game banned item reporting
